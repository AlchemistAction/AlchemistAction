I've been a backend developer since 2019. I can quickly adapt to technologies and development areas that are new for me.
Moreover, I'm interested in studying and always open to challenges and projects with many research and non-trivial tasks.
I always try to do my work responsibly. Also, I have experience working in a team and always try to contribute to our work projects.
